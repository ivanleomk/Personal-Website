# Introduction

2022 is finally here and i'm excited to make some new progress on my journey to becoming a better developer. I've been doing some googleing here and there and i've found some cool stuff.

This was inspired by [Ben Awad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQzrGffpIGI)'s video where he talked about the new technologies that he wanted to learn and I'd thought it'll be good to do a video at the start of the idea declaring my intentions and see how far I come from there at the end of the year.

## On The Frontend

### Next JS

This year i'd like to work on my frontend ability and really explore more about NextJS. I think it's a fantastic library and I definitely want to learn more about it. Some features that I'm keen on exploring are:

- Testing in NextJS
- Serverless Functions to help abstract away certain tasks
- NextJS with TypeScript
- Incremental Static Regenerations

### Typescript

I'd like to continue working on my Typescript knowledge and explore more. I'm particular keen on learning about

- Conditional Types
- Union Types

and more in the future.

## On The Backend

### Graphql

I think that GraphQL is the future of web development because of it's flexibility. I'm currently working with Postgraphile which has no vendor lock-in and can be deployed as a dependency in your express app. I think that's awesome and I can't wait to get better at using it.

### Post Graphile

I think that Postgraphile is a good technology because of it's ease of integration. I'm not too sure at the moment about

- Access control using PostGraphiel
- Mutations/How to best go about doing them
- Caching Best Practices

## Infrastructure Wise

### Github Actions

I've been utilising random github actions for a while now and I'm really enjoying it. I've been reading more about how to use it for

- General Formatting
- Lighthouse Validation
- Automatic Deployments/Notifications
- and more

This sounds like a fantastic thing to learn more about.

### Cypress

I've been putting off testing for a long time for many of my apps and I've read quite a bit about Cypress and how it's able to automate a large amount of testing. I think that having some good e2e testing coupled with Github Actions will help catch a large proportion of my bugs and I look forward to doing so.

### CDNs

I'd like to learn more about how to use CDNs , especially as I start to develop more complex apps. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that yet but I'm looking forward to it.

### Serverless Technologies.

I'd like to spend more time learning about Serverless Technologies.
