# The Framework

2022 is finally here and I'm super excited for the year ahead. I'll just briefly outline my goals according to a few different dimensions - **emotional, physical ,professional and financial**.

## Emotional

2021 was a really rough year for me. Personally it was a year of huge changes as I navigated my first corporate internship, a painful breakup and perhaps my first lockdown experience alone. It wasn't all too bad in retrospect and I think that I came out a lot stronger because of it.

I used to think that in order to work on important things, you had to simply just ignore your emotions and power on. 2021 however, showed me that that wasn't going to happen. I had to spend a large amount of time dealing with my own emotions and anxiety ridden days after I broke up with my girlfriend and i couldn't just push things aside as I used to do.

I was fortunate enough to recieve some good counselling and have the support of my friends. As a result, I think that i've bounced back a lot stronger from it. I've finally realised the importance of mental health. I'd like to continue working on my own mental health this year and make it a priority for the first time in my life.

The plan for 2022 is simple.

1. Go on a long-term dopamine detox : I think 2021 taught me just how pervasive cheap dopamine sources were in my life. I've found that as I've made changes to my life and reduced the amount of cheap dopamine sources that I consume, I feel happier and better. My ideal state would be to eventually have about 1-2 hours a day of cheap dopamine sources by the middle of the year.

2. Write more : I've found that writing has been a good way for me to get my thoughts from my mind into paper, quieting down a lot of the noise as a result. Just spending a short 10-20 minutes each time to empty out my mind has been truly beneficial for me.

3. Gratitude Journalling : I want to start cultivating an attitude of gratitude towards my daily life and noticing the small things that are around me. I've been doing it for a few days now and I'm curious what half a year of consistent practice might bring

4. Meditate More : I've been meditating for a long time now and I intend to continue working on the habit. I've only managed to consistently meditate for about 10-15 minutes and I'd like to try cranking it up to 1 hour once at some point this year. I think that that would really push myself to the next level and force me to be more present with my day to day life.

## Physical

I started working out in 2021 and managed to pack on a decent amount of muscle for the first time. I've been chubby and a bit overweight for a long time ever since I stopped doing gymnastics and I'm really proud of the changes in my body as a result. I think a big part of it was really just mastering the art of showing up and setting my expectations really really low.

This year my goal is simple, I wanna look shredded. Realistically, this is a year-long endeavour because its pretty stressful to make your body lose too much fat too soon. Currently my plan for the next 5 months is as follows

- January - early February ( ~ 1 month ): I intend to keep my calories low and cut about 1.2kg/week by restricting my calories to around 1000 calories a day. I intend to do so by relying on a few things - a large amount of water intake and volume eating. I'll also be intermittent fasting to increase the amount of fat burnt during the period. I should be down to about 72~73 at this point

- Mid Febuary - end March: I intend to keep myself at maintanence here and resume strength training on a regular basis. This is the recovery phase. I'm not intending to gain a significant amount or lose anything.

- April - end May : I intend to resume the cut here. I should be decently lean at this point. My goal is to hit around ~15% body fat by May so if I'm quite far from 15% I might do another caloric restriction cycle. However, if I'm around 16-17% at this point, I will simply aim for a slightly 2-300 caloric deficit to cut fat slowly. I think 2 months is a long enough time to get a lot done.

The system that I intend to rely on will have a few different components

1. 10,000 daily steps - working towards that daily cardio
2. A modified PPL routine - I've been doing the same PPL for quite some time. I intend to modify it to increase the focus on my arms, delts and back.
3. An increased emphasis on sleeping habits

I intend to go for more classes once the caloric restriction phase is over and I'm really looking forward to that!

## Professional

I have a terrible online profile. I have no personal website at the moment and my github is a bit of a mess. So with that in mind, I intend to

1. Start writing more about technical stuff & my own personal ramblings
2. Configure a good github
3. Start networking ( More towards the later half of the year )
4. Learn more about Web3

I don't really have a solid plan for this at the moment because most of my attention is currently directed towards the physical aspect.

## Financial

# Food For Thought

Some interesting things I'm trying this year

1. 2 week habit cycles
2. Actual dieting
3. Dopamine detox

Hope I succeed lol.
