# The Framework

Normally I tend to evaluate my goals according to a few different dimensions

1. Emotional
2. Physical
3. Professional
4. Social

## Emotional

I've found that I'm a bit of a dumbass so having a bit more of a simple way to audit my goals is probably the best. Let's tackle them one by one.

> Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe

Last year was pretty tough for me. I went through a rather big breakup and I did not take it well. I spent a lot of time dealing with significantly more anxiety and this largely affected my ability to work, think and function.

I was fortunate enough to recieve some good counselling and have the support of my friends. As a result, this enabled me to bounce back a lot strong from it.

This year I'll like to build on that monentum and work on continuing to do the work and work on myself. My plan is quite simple

1. Start with a dopamine detox. If you're not familiar with a dopamine detox, I wrote about it [here](https://ivanleomk.github.io/quartz/notes/Dopamine-Detox/#:~:text=dop) in my digital garden.

2. Do more deep journalling. Deep Journalling to me is spending around 10-20 minutes to write and journal my thoughts on a small notebok I keep. The idea is to do a brain dump and get everything out instead of having it ruminating in my head. I've found this to be useful when dealing with large complex topics.

3. Work on gratitude journalling. I don't really expect this to be significantly difficult to do, just noting down 3 things each day that I care about.

4. Continuing to meditate.

Let's now proceed to define some lag and lead measures in line with the 4DX Process.

I think that some good lead measures could potentially be

1. Time spent on cheap dopamine sources OR Time spent before hitting my first dopamine spike
2. Number of minutes spent meditating per day
3. Number of perfect days where I manage to hit all 3 things - gratitude journalling, meditation and low dopamine intakes

I'll probably write a little more about how my dopamine detox will be like soon. Having a bit more of a concrete measure will be nice to refer to from time to time. I think that some good lag measures could potentially be

1. General Lifestyle Happiness - I'm going to measure this very roughly and just ask myself to rate my happiness every few days. If there's an overall trend, i'll notice it.

2. Number of potential anxiety or stress episodes.
