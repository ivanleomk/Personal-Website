Here is the quick tl;dr version for you to get up and running if you just need a solution.

# Basic Tools

## Install XCode Tools

```js
xcode-select --install
topo
```

## Verify that Git is installed

```
git -- version
```

You should see this output in the terminal once this is set-up

```
git version 2.24.3 (Apple Git-128)
```

## Install VSCode

You can do so by heading to [the official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and downloading the build from them. This should allow you to get quickly set up.

## Install Homebrew

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

You can verify that this is the correct command by looking at the official [Home Brew website](https://brew.sh).

## Installing Node

I've found that it's more useful to install NVM ( Node Version Manager ) instead of just plain old vanilla Node. This helps you to potentially avoid issues when working with packages which are built with older versions of node in mind. Here are the steps as follows

- Install NVM

```
brew install nvm
```

- Install the version of NVM which you wish to use

```
nvm install node #installs the latest version of Node
nvm install [specific version]
```

- Update your bashrc file

```
mkdir ~/.nvm
vim ~/.bash_profile
```

and copy the following lines into your bash file

```
export NVM_DIR = ~/.nvm
source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh
```

Once you've pasted these in, press `:wq` to exit and save the changes

- Next configure a default version of node

```
nvm alias default [version_here]
```

where `[version_here]` stands for whichever version you'd like to configure as the default one. You can find a list of versions by using the command `nvm ls`.
